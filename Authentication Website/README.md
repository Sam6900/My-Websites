# Authentication Website

Flask Auth is a simple yet powerful authentication website built with Flask, Werkzeug, Flask-SQLAlchemy, and Flask-Login. It allows users to create an account and log in to access secure content.

## Installation

To get started, you'll need to install Flask and the other required libraries. You can do this by running the following command:

>  pip install flask werkzeug flask_sqlalchemy flask_login

## Usage

Now you're ready to start the Flask development server and begin using Flask Auth. Simply run the following command:

>  flask run

Once the server is running, you can visit the website at http://localhost:5000 to create an account and log in.

Flask Authentication is easy and intuitive to use. The login is secured using hashing and salting techniques.
